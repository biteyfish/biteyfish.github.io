<p>So far 2010 is off to a rather good start. Let's review what I've done so far!</p>
<p>--Case for my netbook.</p>
<p><a href="http://images4.ravelry.com/uploads/biteyfish/19872294/photo_2__medium.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 375px;height: 500px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/photo_2__medium.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />I'm rather pleased with how it turned out. I designed it myself, just by doing a rough gauge swatch and some quick math (which for once I didn't botch!) Big rectangle, with a droste pattern of alternating knits and purls on the front side. I used Lion Brand Hometown USA yarn for it, which is a super bulky acrylic, which is thick and smooshy enough to make an effective case.</p>
<p>--Mittens!<br /><a href="http://images4.ravelry.com/uploads/biteyfish/20419582/Photo_on_2010-01-13_at_16.35_medium.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 500px;height: 375px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Photo_on_2010-01-13_at_16.35_medium.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Do you remember a while ago when I went nuts for mittens and queued fifty bajillion patterns for mittens and then proceeded to not knit any of them? Well, this pattern isn't any of those patterns. But it is mittens, so I do feel that's a step in the right direction, at least.</p>
<p>They're actually the mittens that Bella (supposedly) wears in <span style="font-style: italic">Twilight</span>. I wouldn't know because I refuse to watch it, at least without several sarcastic friends and copious amounts of alcohol. Since that opportunity has yet to present itself, I've managed to abstain from the Robert Pattinson / <span style="font-style: italic">Twilight</span> mania thus far.</p>
<p>In light of my deep and profound dislike of <span style="font-style: italic">Twilight</span>, it's not unexpected that I swore to myself that I'd never knit these mittens, no matter how pretty I may think they are. However, I kept seeing them around Ravelry. And then I started seeing them around my LYS. And my obsession grew. Then I came to the horrifying realization that I had yarn sitting in my stash that would be perfect for them. And so here they are. Don't judge me.</p>
<p>--Lastly, I knit a little something for my kitty. See how much she likes it? Squee!</p>
<p><a href="http://images4.ravelry.com/uploads/biteyfish/20491116/photo2_medium.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 375px;height: 500px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/photo2_medium.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The reason I took the time to knit all these things when I could be working on my Quadrat is that my Quadrat is evil. EVIL.</p>
<p>I know, I know. My sweater is being mean to me. Huge shock. I know.</p>
<p>So. I swatched. Yep, <span style="font-style: italic">actually</span> swatched, not my usual method of half-assedly knitting a bit and going "eh, close enough!" I knit the ENTIRE square, and then I washed and blocked it, and measured again. Came out bang-on, so I started my sweater.</p>
<p>First off, let me say that the cable cast-on is the devil.</p>
<p>So are sweaters that come with SIX DIFFERENT FRIGGING CHARTS. I knit about thirty rows of the cabling before realizing that I'd switched charts B and D, and the cabling was coming out upside down and generally looked like crap. Before going through the trouble of dropping and reknitting those sections, on a whim I measured....</p>
<p>And.... wait for it....</p>
<p>My fucking gauge is fucking off. It's not coming out smaller, as one would assume with cabling and ribbing. No, it's coming out BIGGER.</p>
<p>So I rip, and start reknitting, and ten rows later I realize I've actually been knitting with one size 7 and one size 8 on my interchangeable circs. Rip, start again. I'm almost done with the sleeve, and I realize that I've made one very made mistake when I ripped. I was so obsessed with not having to cast on 110 stitches with the aforementioned cable cast-on that I didn't rip the nine rows of garter stitch. Which had to be knit in a smaller needle size. Since I went down a needle size, now the cable section and the garter sections are now knit in the same needle size.</p>
<p>Now, the cable section draws in, as cabling/ribbing is wont to do. Which means the garter section is now slightly wider than the cable section, and is now puckery. Which means I get to figure out a way to unravel that section and pick up all 110 stitches and reknit. Because I'm sure as hell not starting this sucker over AGAIN.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further adventures. I'm sure they're coming.</p>
