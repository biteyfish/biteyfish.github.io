<p>Made up a post about how awful my Christmas knitting is going. Blog ate my post. FML.</p>
<p>I'm still working on it. I'm not on the home stretch yet, but the home stretch is in sight. It has been a long and vicious battle every step of the way.</p>
<p>I finished the first half of Secret Knitting Project #9. Started the second half and about a third of the way through the chart stopped working. It took me longer than I care to admit to realize that the problem was happening because I cast on 31 stitches instead of 30. I finished the actual knitting of it at 12:30 this morning, and just sat down to add on the borders. Finished it, cut the yarn, wove in ends, and held it up to admire it before realizing that I used the wrong color of yarn because I was looking at the backside of the thing. Sigh.</p>
<p>I also finished Mom's tiger triangle, bound off, blocked, and then realized that the bind off it too tight. Need to do that over again and reblock.</p>
<p>Got the majority of Sarah's Jayne hat done before realizing I'd messed up the decreases and the crown is too deep. Need to rip back and reknit that and then finish.</p>
<p>Also need to finish Secret Knitting Project #5. I'm over halfway through, and out of everything this is the one I'm looking forward to knitting on. Though that could just be the Malabrigo Twist talking. If I could, I would knit everything out of Malabrigo Twist.</p>
<p>I have some dishcloths I need to finish up, but beyond that I'm calling it done. There's only so much I can do. I could have gotten more done, but it figures that as soon as I decide to quit procrastinating and just get down to it is when I start screwing up everything left and right.</p>
<p>I got as far as charting out a pattern for Secret Project #6, but am going to save that for next year. I will start working on it earlier. I swear I will.</p>
<p>I'm also setting aside projects 1-3. Even though they're relatively short, there's no telling what could go wrong or how long it would end up taking. So I'm saving those ideas for another occasion as well.</p>
<p>Whew. So. Nearly there, nearly there.</p>
