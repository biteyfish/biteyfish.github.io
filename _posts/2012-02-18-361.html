<p>The single thing I hate the most about winter -- and there's so many things to choose from but yes, I am able to narrow it down to one -- is how early it gets dark. We're out of the worst of it, where 3 o'clock feels like early evening and it's black out by 5, but it's still well into night by the time I get home at 6:30. Though this winter has been incredibly mild and free of any heavy snow, the lack of sunlight is really starting to weigh on me.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that now would be a great time for some of that yarn I bought for just this occasion -- Dream in Color Knitosophy in Blossom, or that Paigewood Farms Alyeska in Snow Pea, or even that skein of Cascade 220 Superwash in Hawaiian Nights, since I can't seem to knit much else besides socks lately -- to put a little color back into my evenings. Instead, what am I knitting with now?</p>

<p>Sidenote: Another reason I hate it getting dark so early? No natural sunlight for taking pictures.</p>
<p>This is Jason's Valentine's day present, knit in Cascade 220 worsted in Aporto (scored on sale for 10% off, nyah!) I took him along to <a href="http://naturalstitches.com/">the yarn store</a> and had him pick out some yarn for another pair of house socks since he's well on his way to wearing his other pair to pieces. I cast on late on Tuesday night, and despite not touching them at all on Wednesday the first one is already nearing the halfway point. This is what I love so much about worsted weight socks (other than wearing them on chilly winter days, of course!) An episode of <em>Body of Proof</em>, and I've got a cuff. Another couple hours and I'm done with the leg. I'm hoping to have the pair finished by early next week.</p>
<p>Speaking of finished things, I've got FOs to share! Katie's bootsocks are done, and have already gone off to their new home.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bootsocks2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="bootsocks2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bootsocks2.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="344" /></a></p>
<p>Nani's socks are packaged up and waiting to be shipped off to Florida. They got a wash in some lovely scented Soak and they really softened up nicely. I also finished my <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/quincy">Quincy Hat</a>, picture forthcoming on that, though it may be a while since me being home needs to not only coincide with it being sunny outside but also my hair not looking awful. We'll see. AND, since I needed size 10.5 US DPNs to knit the top of Quincy and my set was currently entangled in the partially knit sleeve of my green raglan, I was finally motivated to just frigging finish it already. So, yay, raglan has one sleeve! And now that Quincy is done the needles are free to knit the second. Maybe I'll even end up with it done before it gets too warm to wear it this year.</p>
<p>In between that I've also managed to put another half an inch on my Boneyard Scarf. Of course, since last I mentioned its horrible pooling and how I didn't care, it's now stopped pooling and begun distributing the colors nicely across its rows. I still don't care. Even though I love the mindlessness of the stockinette, it's slow going on it because of the color. I get enough of muddy browns and struggling splotches of deep evergreen around the city this time of year, thanks.</p>
<p>My fingers are really itching to cast on with that DiC Knitosophy and I'm daydreaming about what pattern I'd pick for all those riotous pinks and oranges, but I want to work through more of my WIP list first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jason's Valentine Socks: navy blue heathered with greenish</li>
<li>Boneyard Shawl: mud and trampled leaves, ugh</li>
<li>raglan sweater: mossy greens and browns, slightly better than Boneyard but not by much</li>
<li>Sarah's Belated Birthday Socks: deep ruby red, better but still not bright enough</li>
</ul>
<p>My Quincy Hat was a lovely goldenrod shade of yellow with just enough black/brown/off-white tweedy bits thrown in to subdue it and I very much enjoyed knitting with it, but that project is done with now.</p>
<p>Maybe some dishcloths, quick and easy projects to sneak in a bit of color.</p>
<p>BastardCat has no opinion on the matter.</p>
