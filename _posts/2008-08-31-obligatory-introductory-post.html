<p>Beginnings are always the most difficult part of writing anything, so I'm going to make this as easy on both of us as I possibly can. Like a band-aid -- one quick tug and it's all over.</p>
<div>I'm a twenty-something native Floridian transplanted to Pennsylvania. Â I read avidly, I knit obsessively, I write, I dance, I play the piano. I don't cook or clean quite as often as I should. I get excited over stupid things, I don't think before I talk, and I laugh at just about anything.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Oh, and I'm really quite awful at blogging.</div>
