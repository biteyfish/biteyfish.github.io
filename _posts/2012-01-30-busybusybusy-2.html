<p>Life has continued to be crazy. Last we left off, I was relaxing on my day off by catching up on lots of cooking and housework, and settling in for a big winter storm. Well, the winter storm didn't turn out to be nearly as bad as predicted. We were supposed to get freezing rain and ice through 2 PM the following day, but the morning dawned clear and sunny and the roads were totally cleared by the time we ventured out. I worked this weekend, and spent every night hanging out with friends. The result? Not a lot of knitting.</p>
<p>I did, however, manage to finish Nani's socks. Love how they turned out, and can't wait to send them off. Still need to weave in the ends, but after that, off they go.</p>

<p>I'm also nearly done with Katie's bootsocks. I'm in the gusset decreases of the second one, and I'm hoping to have it done this week. Have also worked a few more rounds on Sarah's Belated Birthday Socks.</p>
<p>I really need to knit something other than socks. Maybe a nice hat, just to take the edge off...<a href="http://www.roguebibliophile.com/2012/01/30/busybusybusy-2/nanisocks2/" rel="attachment wp-att-341"><br />
