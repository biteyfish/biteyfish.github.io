<p>So, out of curiosity, I sat down and calculated more or less just how much knitting (and crocheting) I've done this year. Since I don't have all of the FOs with me, I had to estimate a few of the stitch counts on various projects. I also didn't take into account projects or sections of projects I ended up frogging.</p>
<p>So, totals!</p>
<p>FOs - 24</p>
<p>Yardage - 9,978.6</p>
<p>Stitch count - 38,947</p>
<p>I'd also be interested to know just how many hours I've spent playing with yarn this year, but that's something I couldn't even begin to estimate. It's definitely a big number, though.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to keep better track of things this year, just to see how it compares with last year. Of course, I always start out the new year with all sorts of things I've said I'm going to do, and then lose interest a month or so in. Though I think I've been realistic in setting my New Year's Resolutions this year...</p>
<p>1. Try to keep my home a bit more organized. This means keeping on top of cleaning and laundry and such.</p>
<p>2. Keep in closer contact with family and friends. I'm usually pretty bad about talking to people. I think about my family and out-of-town friends almost constantly, but rarely take initiative in keeping up with them. I need to be better about this.</p>
<p>3. Finish more knitting projects than I start! Seriously. This probably won't happen, but I'm going to make a serious stab at it.</p>
<p>4. Be more consistent updating here!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, all, and I wish you all lots of happiness and luck in the coming year!</p>
