<p>Finally got around to getting some pictures of Quincy. The sun came out for a while and I flung myself at the opportunity, as did others of the four-pawed variety.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.roguebibliophile.com/?attachment_id=397" rel="attachment wp-att-397"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-397" title="quincy4_medium2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/quincy4_medium2-e1330311187885.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="404" /></a></p>
<p>Surprisingly, BastardCat was nowhere to be seen, but never fear -- Yarneater was more than willing to take his place. I'm sure the wool had nothing to do with luring her around.</p>
<p>So, Quincy. The fit is a little loose and it looks weird if I try to put it on with my hair in a ponytail. But I like it. It'll be nice for transitional weather of the spring and fall.</p>
<p>I used up some of the leftovers from a cropped sweater I'd knit out of Knitpicks City Tweed Heavy Worsted in the colorway Lemon Curd. This only used a little over half a skein, and I still have some of this left over. I'm thinking maybe a matching set of mitts, possibly a cowl as well. I've got a little under two skeins left.</p>
<p>Still knitting away on Jason's socks. Up to the heel turn of the second one, so hopefully I'll be done with them in the next few days. Although that's what I sort of recall saying last week, so we'll see what happens.</p>
<p>Also still resisting the urge to skein up my Wollmeise for my Honey Cowl. So far managing to resist, but only just.</p>
