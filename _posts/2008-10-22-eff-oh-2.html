<p>That's right! Another finished project, go me!! I finished up that scarf I said I was thinking of.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/SP-NE5hkx3I/AAAAAAAAABY/YN283FO6cxc/s1600-h/IMG_0055.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0055.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5260078005092665202" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Ta-da!</p>
<p>...just ignore the partially finished project graveyard on the bottom shelf there... why no, that's not at least half a dozen things I'm pretending are finished but aren't really. Like my <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/special-effects">Special Effects tote</a>, which STILL needs to be lined, or... *ahem*</p>
<p>Anyhow. Moving right along.</p>
<p>See, I was sorting through some old papers and stumbled across some notes from the chemistry class I took freshman year in college, and mixed in with it was a handout of the emission spectra of various elements. My first thought, upon seeing them, was "oh hey, those are scarf-shaped! I bet I could crochet one up in no time!" And so I did. I botched the ending of it - two of the darker purple stripes are spaced too far apart - because I seem to have a complete inability to follow patterns. Although random measurements scribbled on a post-it don't really count as patterns, do they? Ah well. It came out nifty enough, and I figure most people won't be able to tell the difference...</p>
<p>Now I'm back to working on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/rectangular-granny-square-afghan">my afghan</a>, henceforth to be referred to as The Blanket That Will Not End. Because it won't. I crochet and crochet and crochet, and the damned thing never seems to get any bigger. It's like it just eats my yarn and expects me not to notice. Well, I have noticed, you evil thing you! And it has become a battle. I'm armed with NINE MORE SKEINS of yarn. No blanket could eat that much without growing! It will become blanket sized if it's the last thing it does!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/salto">My mother's socks</a>, however, are behaving themselves quite nicely <strike>the little suck-ups...</strike> They're taking longer, because they're worked on tiny little twig-needles, but they're pretty and coming along at the rate I more or less expected them to come along at. And did I mention they're pretty? Because they are. I love cabling.</p>
<p>My yarn diet is going better than I thought it would. I bought some yarn for my <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/hydrogen-scarf">Hydrogen Scarf</a>, but it was on sale and I only bought a few skeins so it doesn't really count. I placed another Knitpicks order, and there was not one lonely little skein of yarn on it! And if that's not willpower, then I don't know what is! Yarn, I can put off buying by making a mental list of all the lovely yarn I'm going to buy after Christmas when my diet is over. But a set of six sizes of sock needles on sale for $20?? Who could pass that up? Yes, yes, I know I already have the Harmony wood sock needles. But I've discovered that I dislike working with wood needles at that small a guage. I'm afraid I'm going to snap one of them, and then where would I be? So I ordered the nickel plated ones. Because they were on sale. Erm, yes.</p>
<p>Beyond that, nothing's really going on. I still need to swatch for my Sesame sweater, but I'm dragging my feet on it. That's going to be the project I work on while I'm home for Christmas, plus I've got this BTWNE that I HAVE to finish by mid-December, and the socks I really should finish by Thanksgiving. Plus <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/binary">Jason's binary scarf</a> that still needs to be tinked back several rows... ::sigh:: Plus I'm in a bit of a knitting slump at the moment. Probably because I'm neither buying yarn nor starting a billion projects at once... Bluh.</p>
