<p>I know I have. I am a bad, bad blogger. I suck. I know.</p>
<p>But! I offer you pretty pretty pictures in return for your forgiveness! Dane shawl is bound off, blocked, and already happy in its new home with Rina. I'm in love with it. I really want to knit another one. For myself. Which I would keep for me and wear all the time. Mmmm, love.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/SyrULwu5iOI/AAAAAAAAAGc/mgMhyfuDOdA/s1600-h/Photo+on+2009-11-22+at+11.25.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 400px;height: 300px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Photo+on+2009-11-22+at+11.25.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5416374800391702754" border="0" /></a><br />I also finally took pictures of other FOs I'd been meaning to photograph for a while now. My Silk Garden Kerchief, for instance. I'm really happy with how it came out. It's very warm, and I've been wearing it pretty often. I was slightly less than thrilled with how the colors came out, but it's since grown on me...</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/SyrT083bp0I/AAAAAAAAAGU/6NHHGHezD_s/s1600-h/IMG_0811.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 400px;height: 300px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0811.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5416374408511727426" border="0" /></a><br />Then there's my Envy. This was half-finished for a while, but I finally got off my lazy ass and sewed the buttons on it so it's actually, ya know, wearable. I'm pretty happy with this as well. It's a pretty color that looks nice against my grey coat.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/SyrTnIMWTQI/AAAAAAAAAGM/E1kF1Cmo_z4/s1600-h/IMG_0812.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 300px;height: 400px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0812.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5416374171034078466" border="0" /></a><br />And this is my latest FO, which I am so so so happy with. It's for my friend Jon. It's a little big on me, but fits him well, and was very well-received. He put it on right away and went around showing everyone. He's been wearing it all week, which makes me feel all warm-and-fuzzy inside. Nothing like knitting something for someone and having them really appreciate it. Makes me want to knit tons of things for everyone! But I'm too lazy for that, really...</p>

And still putting off finishing J-L's hat. (hence the blogging! nothing like a good lengthy picture-filled post to put off knitting something I don't want to knit!)</p>
<p>I'm also planning more projects. Yep. I know. Heard it already.</p>
<p>I'm in love with <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter09/PATTquadrat.php">Quadrat</a> from the latest issue of Knitty. Mmmm, boxy cabled sweater. AND I found the perfect yarn for it. I was planning on using Cascade 220 for it, but I stumbled across Cascade Dolce on sale for mega-cheap. Wool/alpaca/silk blend at half off? Don't mind if I do! I ordered it in <a href="http://img2.yarn.com/resources/Yarn/images/products/processed/3444.971.zoom.1.jpg">Silver</a>. Smallest size is for a 33" chest, so I'll be knitting it at a smaller gauge to take off an extra inch or so. I went ahead and ordered more yarn than I'd need for knitting the pattern as-is though, since the reason the Silver is on sale is that it's discontinued. That does make me a bit nervous, but hopefully it'll only serve to motivate me to knit this sucker straight off. That way if something goes horribly, terribly wrong (as it is wont to do) I'll still be able to get my paws on more yarn in that color. Hopefully.</p>
<p>Also in the works are plans for cabled socks, and a hat for Jason. He really liked the one I made for Jon, so he'll be getting one as well. In alpaca. Mostly because I want an excuse to play with alpaca. Also because I love him.</p>
<p>Mmmm, alpaca...</p>
