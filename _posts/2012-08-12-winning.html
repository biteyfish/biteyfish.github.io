<p>It's a long-documented and well-known fact that I never win anything. Never. Random drawings, raffles, contests. No, no, and no. I have the worst luck.</p>
<p>Which makes it really unexpected and really really awesome that I won not one but TWO things last weekend from Natural Stitches Bingo. That I was notified of my winnings right around my birthday is just the icing on that unexpected cake.</p>
<p>As a random drawing, I won this lovely skein of Bitty yarn from Yarn Hollow in the colorway Zen. It's a fingering weight that's a little on the light side -- 490 yds should yield a nice big shawlette.</p>

<p>As my other prize, I won a sweater kit from Blue Sky Alpacas.</p>

<p>I'm at a bit of a crossroads here on what to do with it. It's four skeins of Blue Sky Alpacas Organic Cotton yarn in Ladybug. The kit comes with a pattern for a sleeveless tank, which I do like, but probably wouldn't wear as a tank and especially not during the summer months because I think it would be too bulky. I'd be more likely to wear it layered over a long-sleeved tee during the fall or spring, and if I'm doing that then wouldn't it be smarter to make it out of wool than out of cotton?</p>
<p>Also, the kit came with four skeins of yarn, but the smallest size only requires three, and that means I'll likely end up with one and something left over and I really don't know what else I would do with that.</p>
<p>Know what pattern requires four skeins for its smallest size?</p>

<p>Yeah. Sea and Surf sweater from Superstar Knitting. And I'd planned on making this at some point anyhow so maybe I'll use the Ladybug red yarn for that, and then figure out something else for the tank, because I really do like that as well, and now I have the pattern for it.</p>
<p>I don't know. I'm torn. On the one hand the yarn/pattern came as a kit and I feel like I should use it as such. On the other, since I have four skeins doesn't it make more sense to make a sweater that uses all four skeins? Hm. In any case, I don't have to decide now. My knitting queue is pretty full right now, so I've got time to mull it over.</p>
