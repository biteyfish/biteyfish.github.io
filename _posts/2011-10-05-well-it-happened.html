<p>I knew it would happen sooner or later. Epic Wedding Shawl was just behaving too nicely for it to continue. I was ahead of schedule, I was having no troubles, I was enjoying myself...</p>
<p>I reached the edging, and the lace pattern for that starts after two plain knitted rounds. Blithely carrying on, I started that first set-up round, and at the end of it I had two extra stitches. Irritated but unwilling to fudge the stitch count on something that's a gift for someone else, I sighed a bit, and tinked back 576 frigging stitches. Concentrating now, I attempted the round again. And when I reached the end of it this time, I was short three stitches. After some distinctly unladylike language, I set about tinking back again. Now I'm back where I was before all that wasted time and frustration. I'm waiting until I'm able to lock myself in a room, alone, with no distractions. Because that's apparently what it takes for me to be able to count to nine reliably multiple times in a row.</p>
<p>In the meantime, because I can't watch tv with empty hands...</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Yeah. I know. But it's pretty much exactly what I need right now. Simple. Repetitive. And, above all, short, so as not to distract me from Epic Wedding Shawl for very long. Just a simple washcloth, 31 stitches wide (because I apparently cannot count to 30 reliably either...), worked in tunisian simple stitch until I have a square, then I'll slap a crocheted border on that sucker to keep the curl out of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Hopefully by the time I finish it I'll be ready to tackle Epic Wedding Shawl again.</p>
