<p>Yay! So I finished my <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/on-the-fly-hat">on the fly hat</a> last weekend, and then immediately jumped into a <a href="http://knitty.com/ISSUEfall07/PATTfoliage.html">Foliage Hat</a> from the Lamb's Pride bulky I bought. Imagine that! I went out, bought yarn, came home, and started a project with it. I know, I know, I almost fainted when I realized what I did. Yipes.</p>
<p>It came out more-or-less pretty. There's one section that I mucked up. I think I missed some YOs since two of the diamond leafy bits are sort of fused into one vaguely misshapen lump. I noticed my mistake five or six rows later, and, unwilling to rip them out, I simply dropped that section and reknit. It came out slightly less misshapen, but still wrong. Whatever. The lace pattern more-or-less hides the error, and when I shoved the hat under my non-knitting fiance's nose and demanded "What's wrong with this!?" he couldn't spot the error. So I just wear that bit in the back and try not to think too much about it.</p>
<p>Things I learned on this hat:
<ol>
<li>How to read a chart. I've never knit anything from a chart before, and this was a simple enough chart to read. Hurrah, I did it!</li>
<li>How to knit a hat top-down. All my previous hats have been cuff-up. I was thrilled at the complete and utter lack of casting on!</li>
<li>That working a simple bind-off on the ribbing of a top-down hat results in said hat not being over to fit over my head. A very painful lesson, but one I learned well.</li>
<li>The sewn bind-off is pure magic.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've also cast on my first pair of socks for my knitalong. I'm using the Araucania Ranco Multy that I bought from simplysockyarn.com, and it is wonderful. Sturdy, but soft, and the mild color variation is just amazing. Love love love. I'm knitting the <a href="http://knitty.com/ISSUEwinter08/KSPATTblackrose.php">Blackrose Socks</a> from the latest issue of Knitty, and I also love it, and I especially love the pattern and the yarn together. Unfortunately, I'm about to go frog about half of what I've knit of the first leg. See, it all began with a missed yarn-over...</p>
<p>I was admiring my three inches of sock leg, when I noticed IT. A solid bit where there should be a hole. Could it be? *gasp!* I missed a yarn-over! With a surge of dread I recalled when on the prior lace repeat, I'd ended up a stitch short. Unable to spot my error at the time, I just picked up an extra stitch and kept knitting.</p>
<p>Now that I'd spotted it, I couldn't stop staring at the error. Sure that I was being crazy, I shoved the sock under my fiance's nose and demanded "What's wrong with this!?" After peering at it for a moment, he pointed <span style="font-style: italic">right where the yarn-over should be </span>and said "Something looks funny right here... is it missing a hole?"</p>
<p>Arrrrgh! So I'm not crazy! Even my non-knitting fiance who can't spot the gaping holes or stains on his own socks, was able to see my glaring little error!! But alas, it was twenty rows ago and I really REALLY didn't want to drop those stitches down to fix it. Dropping a section of lace to add in my one little missed yarn-over isn't my idea of fun, and I'm so new at knitting lace I'd probably screw it up more. Oh well, I reasoned, that part of the leg will be under my pants, and who's going to be putting their face close enough to my feet to spot it even if I wear these socks with a skirt? So I kept knitting.</p>
<p>But I was so preoccupied that I repeated one of the lace rows an extra time. So the lace patterns on my socks go normal-normal-normal-too long-too short. Arrrrgh and double-arrrrgh! So I have to frog back the whole sock to fix that. And since I'm already going to be frogging, I might as well just rip back to where that stupid missed yarn-over was in the first place. *sigh*</p>
<p>Where I was:</p>

<p>Where I am:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/SW-oTDBJROI/AAAAAAAAADY/57X7251Y79E/s1600-h/IMG_0167.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 300px;height: 400px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0167.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5291633132364711138" border="0" /></a>Tragic, to be sure, but really, two inches was a small price to pay to be able to knit in peace. The error would have bothered me THAT MUCH. Yes. I know I'm neurotic.</p>
<p>Now I'm off to knit and continue watching Desperate Housewives. I think I can get back to where I was by the end of the evening...</p>
