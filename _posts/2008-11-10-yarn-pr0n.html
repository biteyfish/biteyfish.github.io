<p>Yep, that's right! Time for more showing off of the yarn! Apologies for the less-than-awesome pictures. These were taken with my phone, and it's way overcast today.</p>
<p>Here we have one skein of Lamb's Pride Worsted in Deep Pine (which is actually a brighter deep emerald-like color, not the washed out bluh the crappy picture implies.) It's for Jason's <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/binary-cable-hat">Binary Cable Hat</a>. This is my attempt to put a little color into his winter attire. I figure I can trick him into wearing something a bit more colorful than his comfort zone seems to allow if the pattern is geeky enough.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/SRiRY6xhyTI/AAAAAAAAACA/jijR8U0PhfE/s1600-h/IMG_0073.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 400px;height: 300px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0073.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267119621489674546" border="0" /></a><br />Then there's a skein of 6-ply ONline Supersocke. The ball band is in what appears to be German, and the colorway as best I can figure it is just "1092." This will eventually be socks for Jason. I'd already bought two skeins of Knitpicks Palette for socks for him, but after starting to knit up my mother's socks, I realized there won't be enough yarn there to knit up socks for his great big man-feet. So here we are with this. He picked it out himself. This is a perfect example of his "comfort zone" of colors. ::sigh::</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/SRiReLu15rI/AAAAAAAAACI/T7Mmnk1S5ig/s1600-h/IMG_0074.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 400px;height: 300px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0074.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267119711941158578" border="0" /></a><br />And last but not least we have two skeins of Cascade's Sassy Stripes. Again, the colors are much prettier than the picture implies. Because I have tiny feet and stick legs, I'm betting that I've got enough yarn here to make me a pair of knee socks. I intend for this to be my first attempt at toe-up socks. Probably won't get around to it until after Christmas, but until then!<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/SRiRj06XfVI/AAAAAAAAACQ/yBzAKlA0rck/s1600-h/IMG_0075.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 400px;height: 300px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0075.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267119808894696786" border="0" /></a><br />So, yes, I did cheat on my yarn diet. Technically. But all the yarn was on sale. The majority of it is for gifts for someone else. And we all know that sock yarn doesn't <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> count as stash. So, all in all, I think I'm okay. At least that's what I keep telling myself.</p>
<p>In other fabulous news, my mother's socks (which you can see being neglected in the upper right corner of the photos) are coming along nicely. I finally hit the heel flap on the first sock and I'm a little alarmed at how long the leg is. It's definitely longer than I expected. I poked around pictures of other people's FOs on Ravelry, and some people's look as long as mine, while others look to be a good three to four inches shorter. I'm very confused, because I followed the pattern correctly. I figure I'll just keep going with it, mostly because I'll be damned if I have to frog this thing. It took me a ridiculously long time to do.</p>
<p>The BTWNE is still not ending. I didn't work on it at all yesterday, because I hate it and am avoiding it. I'll probably work on it some tonight during Terminator and Heroes. At least good tv makes its endless monotony bearable.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I'm going to my very first knitting group ever! Natural Stitches here in Pittsburgh has a Ravelry group on Tuesday evenings, and I'm going to go. And it will be awesome.</p>
