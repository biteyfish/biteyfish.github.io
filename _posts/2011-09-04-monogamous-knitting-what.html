<p>First and foremost, welcome to the new blog! I'm also expanding a bit, and will be blogging about more than just my knitting, which will hopefully encourage me to post more often and more consistently. Yes, despite life's best efforts, I remain optimistic!</p>
<p>In other news, the Epic Wedding Shawl Adventure continues, and thankfully it is still not very much of an adventure. More of a long endless march. Through a swamp. With mosquitoes. In leaking boots, at night. With no end in sight.</p>
<p>Oh my god, I'm going to be knitting this thing for the rest of my damn life.</p>
<p>I may be overreacting, but if I am it is only very slightly. Each round is now 576 stitches and the plain knitting rounds alone take me almost 20 minutes. I sat down and out of what I can only assume is an acute sense of masochism, I decided that I wanted to figure out just how may stitches are in the shawl all together. The answer?</p>
<p>65,061</p>
<p>Not including the bind-off. And at a rate of about 30 stitches a minute (see? there's that optimism again!) that translates to a total of just over 36 hours of work. This is a very conservative effort because it doesn't include any of the times I've had to tink back, or the two inches I had to rip back because of my inability to follow a stinkin' pattern, or all the times I've had to pause to read my work because I've lost track of where I am in the lace. Or the fact that I'm pretty sure the lace rounds slow me down to somewhat less than 30 stitches a minute.</p>
<p>Yeah. I was better off not knowing. Because also according to the stitch count, I am still less than halfway through. I am still confident that I'll have it done by November, but only if I work on it every day without fail. Every day. Without. Fail.</p>
<p>Now, I've never been good at sticking to one thing and seeing it through to the end before moving on to the next one. Both my WIP basket as well as the stack of half-learned music atop my piano, backed up solidly by all the other half-finished projects hidden about my house, can attest to that. And now I have to stick faithfully and unwaveringly to a single solitary knitting project.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>So of course the first thing I do after coming to that particular realization is waste about half an hour browsing Ravelry for fingerless mitts patterns. (Note: I am still steadfastly ignoring the fifty bajillion patterns for <em>mittens</em>Â that I queued up way back when. Fingerless mitts are way different, dontchaknow.)</p>
<p>I'm currently stuck on the <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEff11/PATTcommuter.php">Commuter Fingerless Mitts</a> from the latest issue of knitty.</p>

<p>I'm thinking they'd look pretty fantastic in my one lonely skein of Malabrigo worsted in Emerald Blue that has been languishing in the stash for somewhat longer than I really am comfortable remembering. I love how chilly and perfectly wintery this colorway is, and with some funky silver buttons? Oooh, I'm having to restrain myself from diving for my dpns and casting on right this minute...</p>

<p>The only thing that's keeping me firmly in my seat is the Epic Wedding Shawl sitting balefully beside me, where I've been neglecting it for the last twenty minutes to type up this blog post and half-watch School of Rock for the dozenth time. Also, I know that if I fall off the wagon even once, I'm going to be quick to hop off it the next time, and the next, and the next, and then I'll be sitting up at midnight the day before it has to be done, swearing at two-months-ago Leandra for not working on it more consistently. I don't want to do that.</p>
<p>Also, I haven't knit anything with any yarn heavier than fingering weight since starting my Citron at the end of June. My relationship with keeping a consistant gauge is tenuous at best, so I figure knitting with lighter-weight yarns for the duration of The Adventure can only help.</p>
