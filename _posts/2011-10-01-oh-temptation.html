<p>The urge to cast on something new is almost overwhelming. Epic Wedding Shawl is nearly complete. I've finished the last lace round, and now just have to knit the edging and I'm free to knit ALL THE THINGS.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, the awful and extremely convincing Voice of Temptation is busy whispering in my ears. The weather here is so grey and gloomy that I'm really craving something brighter. And besides, I've got nearly a month to get this done, so taking a little break from Epic Wedding Shawl for a day or so would be absolutely fine and, really, for the best. After all, a little time away for each other would only make us appreciate each other that much more when we are reunited.</p>
<p>But I'm not going to set foot down that path because once I do I know there's no way back. I'll just keep casting on things and knitting for a bit and then ditching it like a bad boyfriend and casting on something new JUST BECAUSE I CAN. And then that will just keep going on and on and nothing will get finished and it will all end in tears.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Stay strong, Leandra, you're nearly there...</p>
