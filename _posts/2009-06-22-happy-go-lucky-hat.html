<p>It's that time again! That's right! I finished another project! No, it's not a project on my Plan of Attack. Yeah, that Plan has pretty much fallen to the wayside. But it's cute! And so what if it's late June, I'm gonna wear it anyhow!</p>

And I'm pretty much back to seaming my soul-sucking sweater of suffering. Do. Not. Want.</p>
<p>Is it bad that I want to start anther project?</p>
