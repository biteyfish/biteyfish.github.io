<p>So, as you may have figured out by now, I've abandoned my 52 books in 52 weeks goal thingy. This is both good and bad, however. Bad because I've completely abandoned posting reviews of them here. I ended up getting on goodreads.com and have been using that to keep track of it. The good bit, however, is that here I am at the beginning of May and I'm 39 books in. So I've upped my goal to 100 books . And since I don't fancy writing up that damn many reviews, ya'll will just have to live without. Shouldn't be too hard, since I don't think anyone reads this. (Except Jason. Hi Jason!)

<div>I'm going to have to throw together an actual knitting post soonish. Haven't been knitting too much, but I've nearly completed a pair of socks. Woo socks!</div>
