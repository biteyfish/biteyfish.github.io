<p><strong>Book 12</strong> - <em>Seer of Sevenwaters </em>by Juliet Marillier</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. It started off a bit slow and gradually built up anticipation. The long build-up really worked well, and by about page 200 the story really took off with a bang and I had a difficult time setting the book aside at all. Marillier does a brilliant job of foreshadowing, and she sets (and sticks to) a slow but relentless build-up to the climax that I found to be very effective.</p>
<p>Rating: B+</p>
<p><strong>Book 13 </strong>- <em>Treachery in Death</em> by J.D. Robb</p>
<p>To save on time, I'm just going to recommend my <a href="http://knittergeek.blogspot.com/2011/02/books-4-5-and-6.html">earlier review</a> for previous book in the In Death series. I don't have anything new to say about the writing, but Robb is an absolute beast when it comes to pumping out the fiction.</p>
<p>Rating: B</p>
<p><strong>Book 14</strong> - <em>Bar None: A Tale of  Chilling Suspense, Apocalyptic Beauty, and Fine Ales</em> by Tim Lebbon</p>
<p>A very intersting take on zombie apocalypse with a supernatural twist. At just under 200 pages it was a very quick read. The main character marks important moments of his life with different ales, much as other people do with songs, which I found interesting.</p>
<p>Rating: C</p>
<p><strong>Book 15<em> </em></strong><em>- The Bards of Bone Plain</em> by Patricia McKillip</p>
<p>I loved this book. The world had depth, the characters were intriguing, and it was some of the most beautiful writing I've encountered in quite some time. The descriptions were phenomenal.</p>
<p>Rating: A</p>
<p>I feel like I fell down on these reviews somewhat, but I didn't sleep well last night so my brain is about fried. Might come back and edit later if I remember.</p>
