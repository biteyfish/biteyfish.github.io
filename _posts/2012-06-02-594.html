<p>Since I had the day off on Monday, I've been thrown off by a day pretty much all week. Even Friday felt very much like a Thursday, so the end of the day had rather a nice "Surprise! It's the weekend!" thing going on for it. And it's been a pretty good week, knitwise.</p>
<p>The Lace Stripe Scarf got a wash and a blocking and has gone off to its new home. I'm pleased to say that the recipient was quite happy to be given it, and I'm happy that she's happy. I'm also really happy with how it came out, and have been thinking that I just might need one of these for myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roguebibliophile.com/2012/06/02/594/uploadedimage_medium214/" rel="attachment wp-att-609"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-609" title="lacestripescarf1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/uploadedImage_medium214-e1338681438481.png" alt="" width="450" height="602" /></a></p>
<p>I did enjoy knitting it (despite having to rip out the same $#%*@&amp; ten rows every pattern repeat) and found the pattern to be simple and easily memorized (aside from my own inability to focus for more than five minutes at a time or count reliably to six.) The Madeline Tosh DK was obviously the best part.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roguebibliophile.com/2012/06/02/594/uploadedimage_medium216/" rel="attachment wp-att-613"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-613" title="lacestripescarf2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/uploadedImage_medium216-e1338681664402.png" alt="" width="450" height="602" /></a></p>
<p>Gorgeous color, deliciously soft and a real pleasure to knit with. I'd like to make my second Lace Stripe out of that as well (probably in a deeper colorway) but since Tosh is somewhat pricey, it's not going to be a while. Probably not until I need enough of a Webs order to qualify for a discount, and <em>that</em> likely won't happen until after Christmas.</p>
<p>But it's not like I don't have enough else to keep me occupied until then. I'm still knitting away on Larch. It was nice outside, so we went to sit on the porch for a bit. Bastardcat joined us. After putting all the plants out of his reach, and keeping him from taking a nosedive off the balcony, we even had time to knit for a little while!</p>

<p>It's taking longer than I'd like it to. After the botched yarn-over debacle that led to me having to take the blasted thing off the needles, frog five rows and get it back on the needles, I've now taken to doing yarn-overs correctly, but putting them in the wrong places. I know. I don't know what's going on either. I did it three separate times in the last two evenings. The first time, I didn't catch it until the next lace row stopped working. I just dropped that stitch, used a small crochet hook to even out the stitches and just kept going. Then I did it again, but this time caught it on the next row. Again, I just dropped it, tugged on the stitches to either side of it to even them out, and carried on.</p>
<p>The third time, well, I don't know what the hell I did. I put a yarn-over in the wrong spot (again) and didn't catch it until four rows later the lace shaping stopped working (again) and so I (again) just dropped that extra stitch. And somehow that stitch dropped PAST where the mistaken yarn-over was and kept running. I don't know how that happened. It shouldn't have happened. I don't know how to fix it, and when I tried to fix it the whole thing turned into a bigger mess. So I'm going to have to take the needles out and rip back to the mistake (again, damn it) and I really really don't want to do that so I shoved the whole offending mess back into its bag and instead cast on for this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roguebibliophile.com/2012/06/02/594/uploadedimage_medium25/" rel="attachment wp-att-600"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-600" title="wash2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/uploadedImage_medium25-e1338680615807.png" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></a></p>
<p>Yep, that's the Wash sweater I'm making for Jason. Remember how a while ago I said that I wanted to knit a cabled sweater? ...what the hell was I thinking?</p>
<p>I keep doing this to myself. I love the way cabling looks. I fall in love with something that's got cables on it, and I start knitting it, and five rows later I remember how much I despise cabling. Remember <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter09/PATTquadrat.php">Quadrat</a>? This is like that, except bigger. And worse, because while Quadrat had little half-sleeves and the cabling was just across the top section, Wash is covered with cables. And the parts that aren't covered with cables are covered with seed stitch. And the teeny tiny parts that don't have either of those? Ribbing. Not only ribbing... that's twisted ribbing. That bit right up there? That's an hour and 15 minutes worth of work for me. See? I wasn't exaggerating when I said I was a slow knitter.</p>
<p>I'm considering taking the honorable way out and throwing myself upon my size US 10.5s to just end the misery before it's even begun and spare myself all of the upcoming torment.</p>
<p>In an attempt to keep myself sane, I've also cast on this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roguebibliophile.com/2012/06/02/594/uploadedimage_medium21/" rel="attachment wp-att-596"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-596" title="uploadedImage_medium21" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/uploadedImage_medium21-e1338680220834.png" alt="" width="450" height="585" /></a></p>
<p>Not much yet, but it's a wrist cuff for Sarah, since she mentioned that she wanted one the last time I saw her. Cast onto size US 1 needles, worked in linen stitch until it's long enough to fit around a wrist. I'm a half inch in, I need about six more. It's slow going because the stitches are so tiny (fun fact: I've never knit anything on size 1 needles before! I'm not really sure why I felt the urge to do so now.) I stopped by my LYS this morning to pick out buttons for it. I'm still undecided whether I should add two or three to it, so I bought three and when I finish the knitting I'll play around with placement and make a decision then.</p>
<p>Anyhow, when I went into <a href="http://naturalstitches.com/">Natural Stitches</a> on the hunt for buttons, I realized that this is the first weekend of their summer promotion. In years past they always held a "Summer of Socks and Lace" where participants would knit socks or lace things, and whoever had the most yardage got prizes. I never bothered to enter because I knit so slow I couldn't compete. This year, they're doing a knitting bingo thing. They handed me a card with each bingo square marked with a specific task, like taking a class there, or buying a set of needles, or knitting a sweater. A completed line will earn me a $5 gift card, and filling and entire card would get me into a drawing for some "seriously fabulous" prizes. There's no way I'm going to fill the entire card (mostly because one of the tasks is "buy a swift" and I already have a lovely handmade one that was a gift from a friend) but my card has three different lines that I could pretty handily fill out. Sadly, just one line per card is allowed for a turn-in, but if I hand it in, I can get a new card. I just have to decide which line and plan my next project accordingly. Hmmm....</p>
