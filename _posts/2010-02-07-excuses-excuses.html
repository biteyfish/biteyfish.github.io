<p>So, I meant to blog more often. Really, I actually meant it this time. And then I got sick, and have spent the last week and a half fighting off what has to be the worst cold in the history of people getting colds. I've done a fair amount of knitting, and not much else.</p>
<p>I finished my socks.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/S28ccLms9CI/AAAAAAAAAGo/bRWUoYpHAQ4/s1600-h/Photo+on+2010-01-31+at+16.07.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 400px;height: 300px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Photo+on+2010-01-31+at+16.07.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5435594545736512546" border="0" /></a><br />And, yep, they fit perfectly. I didn't really follow a pattern for them, just cast on a few stitches more than I had for my 48-hour vacation socks. I almost wish that when I recklessly cast on for crap it wouldn't work out, because then I maybe wouldn't be encouraged to do it anymore. Instead, I go "well it worked out last time, it'll be find!" And sometimes that leads to massive, massive disappointment.</p>
<p>I've also been working on my Quadrat again. It seems to be more-or-less behaving itself. I'm up to the neckline, now. So... about a third of the way through it, if yarn usage is anything to go by. Exciting!</p>
<p>I'm also gearing up for the Ravelympics, which is also exciting. I'm going to attempt a February Lady Sweater. In, erm, 16 days? That should be fun. Or crazy. Or another chance to be laughed at for not even casting on. Right.</p>
