<p>I'm knitting a pair of socks from an aran weight yarn. I started them late Friday night and am already at the heel turn on the second sock. (and I've been particularly lazy with knitting this weekend, too!)</p>
<p>I may never knit socks out of fingering weight yarn again.</p>
<p>Erm, at least until I set eyes on something pretty and then just omfg have to have it. Because that pretty much always happens.</p>
<p>Sweater is still in time-out on the mantle. I'm going to tackle it when I'm on the high I'll get after finishing a pair of socks in a weekend. That's the plan. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Uh, don't answer that.</p>
