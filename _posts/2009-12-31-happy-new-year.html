<p>Yep, it's that time again! Sitting back for a moment and reflecting back upon the last year. It's been a big one for me -- bought my first house, adopted a couple of beautiful Siamese kittens, got married... It's been a year of milestones for me.</p>
<p>I thought it'd been a big year for me knitwise as well, but I was surprised to learn that I was actually far less productive than I was last year.</p>
<p>2009 saw:<br />--22 total finished projects<br />--5961 yards of yarn used up</p>
<p>As compared to 2008...</p>
<p>--24 finished projects<br />--9,979 yards of yarn used up</p>
<p>I'd only finished two more projects in 2008, and for a minute I didn't feel so bad, until I realized that 3 of my 2008 projects were crocheted afghans. Yikes. I blame it on the fact that what with moving into my new house I lost a lot of knitting time. And the fact that I've just been lazy...</p>
<p>So, resolutions...</p>
<p>1. Keep more organized in all aspects of my life. Need to keep more on top of housework, and keep my knitting and yarn more organized.</p>
<p>2. I need to be far more productive knittingwise. I have several large WIPs I need to get done, and I have some projects I've had planned out forever that I'd like to finish up as well.</p>
<p>3. I want to work through at least half my stash this year. No more buying yarn I don't have a project in mind for, and I'm only allowing myself to buy one skein of yarn for every two I work though from my stash. Realistically, as long as I can get my stash to fit comfortably on its shelf I'll be happy.</p>
<p>4. I want to work on my writing more this year. I want to have my book finished by summer, and ideally have a good chunk of the first in the trilogy rewritten.</p>
<p>5. I want to read more. For some reason I've stopped reading as much as I used to and I really want to get back to that.</p>
<p>Here's to hoping 2010 is even better than last year!</p>
