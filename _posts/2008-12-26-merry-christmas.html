<p>So, um, yeah. This whole posting regularly thing. I suck at it.</p>
<p>The holidays have been insane so far. But despite that I do have some FOs to report.</p>
<p>Seamed my cupcake and it is cute! Yay!</p>
<p>The BTWNE is finally finally done!! And it came out really really nice! When I laid it out to take pictures of it, I was thinking to myself, "damn that came out well! I should make another one, I've got enough yarn left over-" And then reality kicked in and I remember how much I hated this evil thing while I was making it. So I think I'll let the memory fade a bit before jumping into that again...</p>
<p>Erm, and I swear the pics of it will be up soon-ish....</p>
<p>Harry Potter socks are still not done. I'm almost to the toe decreases on the second one. I'm a little sad I'm going to have to mail them to Rina, but I'm only human.</p>
<p>So. Christmas.</p>
<p>Evidently I've been a very good girl this year, because Santa brought me another skein of Harry Potter yarn in the <a href="http://www.simplysockyarn.com/stores/s/SimplySocks/catalog/HP2352Hedwig_2.jpg">Hedwig colorway</a>, the <a href="http://www.knitpicks.com/Andean+Chullo+Hat+Kit_AD40072.html">Andean Chullo hat</a> kit, and the set of <a href="http://www.knitpicks.com/images/regular/90335.jpg">Knitpicks Options</a> interchangeable circular needles. Hurrah! Unfortunately two of the needles (one size 7 and one size 8.) won't screw all the way down onto the cables so I'm going to have to call about that. ::sigh:: But I love them already!! They're sharp and shiny slippery and really, what else could one want with needles?</p>
<p>Santa also brough me Christmas checks cleverly labelled as from various relatives. I'm going on a yarn-buying spree. There's several items I've been wanting (mmmMalabrigo sock yarn...) and I think this is just the excuse I've been needing to get some. Pictures will come eventually.</p>
