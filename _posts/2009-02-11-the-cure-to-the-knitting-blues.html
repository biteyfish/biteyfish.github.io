<p>I've rediscovered my itch to knit. And, who knew, the answer was so astoundingly simply I'm surprised I didn't discover it before. I'm sure I'll pounce on it quickly from now on.</p>
<p>The way to kick myself out of a knitting slump, I've found, is to buy more yarn.</p>
<p>(two skeins of <a href="http://www.straw.com/cpy/yarns/images/maizy-1009neptune.jpg">Crystal Palace Yarns Maizy in Neptune</a> and one skein of <a href="http://www.kertzer.com/Portals/0/images/ON222004-Sage-Heather.jpg">On Your Toes in Sage Heather</a> - both of which I bought on sale! $12 total for two socks' worth of yarn, go me!)</p>
<p>I know this sounds like a thinly-veiled excuse to further expand my stash, but it really worked. When I have a new skein of yarn, I immediately start thinking of what patterns would work with those yarns, and all the things I could make with them, and on and on, and then suddenly I want to make things with them, but to do that I have to finish what I'm making now, and bang! just like that I want to knit again.</p>
<p>And besides. Everyone knows that sock yarn doesn't really count as stash.</p>
