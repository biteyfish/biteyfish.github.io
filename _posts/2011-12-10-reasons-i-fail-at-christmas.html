<p>The biggest reason, of course, would be procrastination. Here we are, with just 14 days until Christmas, and most of my projects are still not done. That's not even including the other shopping I have to do to get ready. As usual, I've been putting off all the things I need to do, and now it's nearly the last minute and I'm starting to feel the first flutters of panic that I won't get everything done on time, which is totally stupid. It's not like the day Christmas happens is a surprise every year. It's not like I didn't know this was coming. In fact, I started planning for this weeks and weeks ago. And then I proceeded to procrastinate. I've got plenty of time, thought I, Surely it won't matter if I don't work on Christmas things tonight...</p>
<p>And now here we are. Okay, it's time to get serious about this. I haven't yet reached the point where anything is impossible. I've still got <del>plenty of</del> time.</p>
<p>The other reason I fail at Christmas is because when I <em>do</em> actually finish something, I face the unendurable temptation to give it away early. Two gifts have already gone out to their recipients. One, though, I had a very good reason for and had planned to send off early all along. I knit my brother-in-law's girlfriend a set of veggie themed Christmas ornaments. She received them today and seems to really like them. I'm pleased with how they turned out as well. I don't usually like knitting things that are small and fiddly like that, but every time I finished one and stuffed it and then held it up completed, I was so completely and utterly charmed by how cute and <em>little</em> it is, I got almost giddy and then went around exclaiming to everyone around me (read: Jason, who was very patient and supportive throughout my tiny-veggie-induced insanity) and grinning madly about it, and that got me through all seven of them.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I packed them up in a tupperware (best wrapping idea ever!) and mailed them off last week so that she'd have some time to enjoy them this year. It seemed silly to save them for actual-Christmas and then she'd have to pack them right up away to save for next year.</p>
<p>The other gift was a hat for Jason. I'd meant to wait until Christmas, but it's been so cold here and last weekend we were out all day Saturday, and before I knew what I was doing I'd gotten out the hat and plunked it down on his little head. The yarn is baby alpaca so it's super soft and very warm.</p>

<p>He's been wearing it pretty much every day since then and, of course, is very pleased that it covers his ears. I'm happy he's happy.</p>
<p>And now, back to knitting...</p>
