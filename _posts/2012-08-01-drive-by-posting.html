<p>Okay, this is gonna be a fast one. The Olympics have started, but I only just got around to picking up the needles for my Ravellenics projects. I've been preoccupied by Bingo! I did end up completing both a straight Bingo, as well as the July Special Bingo. I got a new card for August as well, but I'm not sure whether or not I'll finish it, since most of the month will be dedicated to Ravellenics, and then I have some WIPs I'd like to get finished before I jump into my Fall knitting, which is usually followed quickly by my Christmas knitting. Busy busy busy.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I've been productive and have got some stuff done. I finished my first Christmas knitting project. No pictures of that, sorry, I don't want to spoil the surprise. I also finished my gloves. I hated knitting them. All the stupid fingers with their short rounds, and all the stupid ends that I had to weave in. But all of that fiddly work was totally eclipsed by the joy of having gloves that actually fit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roguebibliophile.com/2012/08/01/drive-by-posting/photo-on-7-31-12-at-11-57-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-737"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-737" title="Photo on 7-31-12 at 11.57 PM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Photo-on-7-31-12-at-11.57-PM-e1343794013301.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="348" /></a></p>
<p>I've got thin hands with long fingers, so this means that if a pair of gloves fits my hand then the fingers are too short. And if I buy larger gloves with longer fingers, then the hand is too loose. So in the winter I either wear mittens, or (more likely) just keep my hands in my pockets.</p>
<p>Now, however, I've got a lovely warm pair of properly fitting gloves. Just in time for, uh, August? At least I'll be well prepared for when Winter finally does arrive.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'll be working on my Ravellenics projects through the 12th. I've resurrected Sarah's Embarassingly Belated Birthday Socks. I worked about half a dozen rounds on them tonight, but am hoping to put a bigger dent in them tomorrow. I'd set these aside because they come with a complicated chart that has lace shaping on every round and I don't like having to pay attention to it. So, to try to keep going on it, I'm going to pair it with a second plainer project that I can knit a few rows on every now and then to take the edge off.</p>
<p>As my second project, I'll be working on her wrist cuff. I didn't like the way that it was coming out: the fabric was way too dense, but the cast-on edge was too loose so one end of it flared oddly. I ripped it out, gave the yarn a quick dunk in the water to get the kinks out so I'm not knitting with yarn that looks like ramen noodles, and will be casting on again with larger needles. I think going up a couple of sizes should fix any issues.</p>
<p>At the end of this, hopefully I'll have two completed projects for Sarah. I think that plus the Ravellenics will be the motivation I need to give me a big enough kick in the butt to finally get these over and done.</p>
