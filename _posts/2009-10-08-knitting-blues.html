<p>Literally. The two projects I'm mainly working on now are blue. I'm really digging it right now, heck if I know why.</p>
<p>So. Anyhow. Last post found me whinging about how I have nothing to knit. Next time I start that crap again, I want someone to point me at this photo:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/Ss5yuuj42hI/AAAAAAAAAFk/XhxmGP5FZ8w/s1600-h/IMG_0729.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 400px;height: 300px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0729.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5390371951107168786" border="0" /></a><br />(please note the copious amount of blue yarn scattered throughout it)</p>
<p>And the next time I start up my Oh woe is me I've got nothing to knit! the appropriate response to that is "Horseshit! You have enough yarn to cover a queen sized bed. Put on your big girl panties and go knit some of it!"</p>
<p>Which is pretty much exactly what I've done. I've pulled out that one lonely skein of Smooshy I've been meaning to knit up, sat down at Ravelry and dug up an appropriate pattern for it. And then I picked up my needles and started knitting it</p>
<p>(swatch? what swatch? swatches are for the weak, baby, I live life on the edge!)</p>
<p>I'd love to say how much I love it and how happy I am putting this yarn with this pattern etc etc etc. I'm really loving the pattern; it's not too difficult, but looks pretty and complex and, well, lacy. I'm ecstatic over the yarn; it's gorgeous and soft and every bit as smooshy as its name implies it should be. But what's coming off my needles . . . well . . .</p>
<p>Frankly, it looks like ass.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/Ss5ylxGukWI/AAAAAAAAAFc/m2gYLT0-Y_U/s1600-h/IMG_0731.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 400px;height: 300px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0731.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5390371797171343714" border="0" /></a><br />Pretty colored ass, but ass nonetheless. To be fair, this is simply the nature of lace, and it's just a blocking away from becoming gorgeous lace, but right now I look at it and all I see is a garbled messy blob of pretty colored ass. And this right here is why I hate knitting lace. I don't mind following a chart. I don't mind counting stitches and desperately searching for where I missed that one damned yarn-over because my last row came up a stitch short. I don't mind actually having to concentrate at my knitting.</p>
<p>But I do dislike looking at what I'm knitting and going "this looks like ass."</p>
<p>I read somewhere that there are two types of knitters: those who do it for the process of knitting, and those who are motivated by the end product. I'm definitely the latter.  The best part of knitting for me is the feeling of pride when I look down at my emerging project, and think to myself "hot damn, I made that!!" or "hey, look! I've knit another two inches!" With lace it's all about delayed gratification because it doesn't get pretty until all the way at the end when it's pinned to the blocking board.</p>
<p>But for now it's rekindled my knitting mojo, so I am grateful for that. Also, it's a gift for someone. Hopefully that will motivate me to keep going on it. Time will tell, I suppose.</p>
<p>I'm off to Virginia this weekend to visit Husband's grandfather. This will be the only project I take along. I'm curious to see how much I'll end up getting done on it. Stay tuned!</p>
