<p>Here we are at New Year's again. I've mentioned before that this is my favorite holiday of the year, but my official New Year's Post with its reflections and resolutions and end-of-year yardage tallies won't come until tomorrow when I've had time to sit down and put all of that good stuff together. I never do it ahead of time, so it's become something of a yearly tradition for me. New Year's Day, I get up and make some tea and then curl up on the sofa with my laptop and spend the first morning of a new year sitting down to reflect on the year that's gone by and make plans for the year that's ahead of me. It's nice.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm spending the last of 2012 at home with Jason. We already celebrated in true "us" form: with cheap champagne and Mario Kart. Now he's playing another game and I'm typing this up. When I finish, I'll get my knitting and we'll sit, quietly, as the last minutes slip by and suddenly it's a new year.</p>
<p>They say that how you spend the New Year and who you spend it with will set the tone for the whole year, and if that's the case then I'd be really happy. I'm hoping I get a nice quiet year. I'd love a quiet year. 2012 was a year of cancer, and surgery, and illness. It was a year filled with too much worry and too many tears and to much disappointment, and frankly I'm glad to see the back of it. 2013 is already shaping up to be a year of weddings, and I take that as a step in a positive direction.</p>
<p>Now, because it's been far too long and it is the last day of the year, why not a few pictures I've neglected to post earlier to finish out my projects?</p>
<p>Here we have the Candy Socks:</p>

<p>Made from ONLine Supersocke 100, they're not the softest socks in the world. The yarn is a bit on the scratchy side, but they're durable as heck and I welcome that.</p>
<p>I also finished my TARDIS socks, and they fit great with my Danskos. I've already worn them a few times and I get tons of compliments each time I do.</p>

<p>I also FINALLY finished Sarah's Extremely Embarrassingly Belated Birthday Socks. They came out just fantastic, and if I hadn't knit them a half-size too big for me I think there's a good chance I would have kept them for myself.</p>

<p>And now it's just 11. That leaves me one hour to get my knitting, to curl up on the sofa with my blanket and my cats and Jason beside me. Together we'll all bring 2012 to a quiet, peaceful end, and we'll start 2013 as we mean to go on.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, a new post, a new year.</p>
