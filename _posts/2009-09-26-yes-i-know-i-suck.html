<p>I honestly have no idea why I suck so hard at posting in this thing. I really need to be better about it.</p>
<p>But I return with some FO hotness in humble offering as a token of my guilt.</p>
<p>Finally got some pics taken of my <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/river-tam-vest">River Tam Vest</a>. It came out so much better than I though it would, considering there wasn't a very specific gauge given for it, and the instructions were only step-by-step for the side panels, and more akin to "helpful guidelines" for the rest of it. I took pretty good notes, and plan to type up my instructions for the rest of it at some point. Maybe later today depending on how motivated I am.</p>

I used the <a href="http://www.lionbrand.com/patterns/70111.html?r=1">Lion Brand Cropped Raglan Sweater</a> pattern with some fairly heavy gauge modifications. But it fits and that's all I care about.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2602/3937887495_1c49b25639.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 375px;height: 500px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3937887495_1c49b25639.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />I used <a href="http://www.knitpicks.com/kpimages/Yarn_Color_Detail/24526.png">Knitpicks HW City Tweed in Lemon Curd</a>, which is a lovely lovely soft smooshy yarn, which, I incidentally found the first time I wore it, also sheds like a white cat on a black couch. I also severely overestimated how much yarn I'd need for this thing. I bought 5 balls, and I used 2 1/2. I'm currently looking for a pattern to make with the rest of this lovely soft warm sheddy yarn.</p>
<p>I'm still working on my <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/silk-kerchief">Silk Garden Kerchief</a>. I've mostly been using it as a mindless-keep-my-hands-busy-so-my-brain-doesn't-wander-off project for during D&amp;D, so it's only been getting about 4-5 hours of on-and-off attention a week. We'll see how long it takes me to finish the thing. Maybe by Christmas.</p>
<p>I've also started a mystery CAL, and so far, despite my track record of starting shit and losing interest shortly thereafter, I'm actually keeping up to speed on it. The group is on Part 4 and I am (gasp!) also on Part 4!! No pics of that, since it's a mystery. But I am using <a href="http://images.diamondyarn.com/catalog/color/200-r/5634.jpg">Fibranatura Yummy in Hawaiian Ocean</a> and I really really like it. The pattern itself is enjoyable, though is pretty intricate and takes a fair bit more concentration than I'm really used to putting into projects lately.</p>
<p>I've got plans for a few more projects I'm going to be starting soonish. After the Silk Garden Kerchief is vanquished into my closet as a wearable garment, I'm going to start another triangle shawl for Rina. I've decided on <a href="http://img2.yarn.com/resources/Yarn/images/products/processed/SMOOSHSOCK.VS170.zoom.1.jpg">Dream in Color Smooshy in Some Summer Sky</a> for the yarn. I'm still looking for an awesome pattern for it.</p>
<p>I'm also going to start the pair of socks I've been promising Jason for about a year now, as well as a log cabin blanket in Lion Brand Homespun. The Ripple Afghan I made in it over a year ago has held up really well, but is too narrow for proper snuggling under, so I'm making a big Log Cabin blanket to replace it. I'm slowly stocking up on skeins thanks to Michaels gratuitous dispensing of 50% off coupons every time you make a purchase. It'll be in different shades of blues and greys. And I'll be crocheting it so it'll go fast!</p>
<p>I'm ALSO going to start a top-down hat in some delicious handspun I bought from a local spinner/dyer. Mmmm, check this out..</p>
