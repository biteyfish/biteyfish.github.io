<p>Okay, very very quick update here.</p>
<p>First off, my needles got here!!! Oh. my. god. I am in love. It's like knitting with sunshine and rainbows and kittens. They are absolutely amazing and I want to knit all freakin' day with these things. All of them. At once.</p>
<p>Secondly, though much less enthusiastically, I have put myself on a very VERY strict yarn diet. No yarn, nada, not even one teensy little skein on sale for pennies even until after Christmas.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and the reason for the secondly, I bought more yarn. Yes, more. On sale. I picked up another skein of black for Jason's Binary Scarf. While there, I also picked up:
<ul>
<li>- 2 skeins of Lion Wool-Ease in Blue Mist. Love the color. It reminds me of oil with all the rainbowy prettiness. I think it'll be great for my second attempt at the <a href="http://magic-fingers.blogspot.com/2007/04/twisted-maiden-fingerless-gloves.html">Twisted Maiden Fingerless Gloves.</a></li>
<li>- 2 skeins of Patons Classic Wool Merino in Cognac Heather. And I've got just the project for this! I should be casting on for my very own <a href="http://kellymaher.wordpress.com/2007/07/04/ribbed-lace-bolero/">Ribbed Lace Bolero</a> in the next day or so.</li>
<li>- 3 skeins of Bernat Berella 4 Ombres in Terra Cotta Mist. The name is pretty stupid, but the colors are nice. They reminded me of fall, and for a dollar a skein, well, who could resist? I don't have a project in mind for it, other than the vague idea of maybe a hat and scarf set. Who knows...</li>
</ul>
<p>Thirdly, and most recently, I just finished my <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/calorimetry">Calorimetry</a>. It was a fairly fast knit. I started it and knit most of it during last night's D&amp;D session, which was fairly slow and more devoted to figuring out puzzles and riddles than actual combat and/or roleplaying. Finished the last quarter or so of it today during a couple episodes of Firefly. The button is my absolute favorite part of it...</p>

<p>Isn't he just adorable??? ^__^</p>
<p>I can't wait until it gets chilly enough to wear it. I've also got plans for a matching neckwarmer. I think that this <a href="http://www.loopknits.com/2007/12/11/herringbone-neck-warmer/">Herringbone Neckwarmer pattern</a> may be just the thing.</p>
