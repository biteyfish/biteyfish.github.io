<p>Today I made a very very very awesome discovery. Or, rather, I made a very very very awesome observation. I've been equally eager lately to work on Jason's <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/binary">Binary Scarf</a>, and the future in-law's <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/biteyfish/rectangular-granny-square-afghan">Christmas blanket</a>. So I've been switching between them. As in, will switch from one to the other and back again in a single tv episode. And what did I notice?</p>
<p>My hands don't hurt!</p>
<p>That's right, apparently by switching between knitting and crocheting, I'm able to play with yarn for far longer pain-free than I am by simply doing one or the other!! Finally, my impatience has done something good!</p>
<p>Now if only I could stop starting things... I'm resisting starting my Ribbed Lace Bolero, but only just...</p>
