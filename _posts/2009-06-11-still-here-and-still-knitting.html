<p>So, believe it or not, I'm still here, and still knitting. I'm moved into my new house (!!!) and more or less settled. The endless round of visiting family has abated (for now...) and my evenings are once again my own. So what have I been doing with them? Why, knitting, of course!</p>
<p>I finally finished up my Tequila Sunrise socks. Yep, at long last. I know. Just as it's too hot to wear handknit socks. But I loves them, and the temperature is supposed to drop a bit later this week, so I'll get some use out of them, at least.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mKklp2U_wvU/SjB1C02CudI/AAAAAAAAAE0/kTuzksrDXg0/s1600-h/IMG_0413.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px;text-align: center;cursor: pointer;width: 400px;height: 300px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0413.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5345901449094281682" border="0" /></a><br />Still seaming up my sweater. I've more or less lost interest in it at this point; I dislike seaming and weaving them ends, and hoo boy are there ever a lot of ends to weave in. Stupid stripes. Stupid me for thinking stupid stripes are cute. And the fact that now that it's summer I won't be able to even wear the thing for another few months has sapped the last of my motivation. I'm trying to force myself to do a little work on it every few days. At this rate, maybe I'll have it done by autumn... I'm not holding my breath, though.</p>
<p>I did end up buying more yarn recently. (Yes, I KNOW) But since it's for a gift, I'm pretending it doesn't count. J-L picked out some colors he liked, and I'm going to be knitting a bulky hat for him. I'd wanted to get it done before he left, but sadly I don't have needles big enough to make gauge with. So it'll have to wait until I can pick some up.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've started a <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/felicity">Felicity Hat</a> with some <a href="http://www.darkhorseyarns.com/images/catalog/thumbs/FA-108%20Jade.jpg">Dark Horse Fantasy in Jade Green</a> that I picked up for 40% off while getting yarn for J-L's hat-to-be. I figured some a short project of mindless stockinette that ends in a cute hat might do me good.</p>
<p>Plan of Attack? What Plan of Attack?</p>
<p>Also, most excitingly, I have picked up a couple of knitting helpers. They've been very diligent about performing such useful services as eating my needles and trying to make off with my yarn.</p>

I'm sure adventures will follow. In the meantime, though, aren't they cuuuuute?? :)</p>
