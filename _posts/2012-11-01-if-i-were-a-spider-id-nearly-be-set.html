<p>I really need to get back into the swing of posting regularly. I think I was doing pretty well for a while, and then there was traveling and work and a bout with <del>the plague</del> a cold, and, well, not a whole heck of a lot of posting. And then, of course, the longer I go without posting the harder it becomes to break my silence. I figure, to make up for not posting in so long then my next post should be really super awesome so as to make up for the vanishing act I've pulled. Problem: my knitting is not being awesome.</p>
<p>I've just been knitting socks. Lots of socks. Well, and a hat. And I did start a sweater. But mostly it's been socks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roguebibliophile.com/2012/11/01/if-i-were-a-spider-id-nearly-be-set/uploadedimage_medium2-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-772"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-772" title="uploadedImage_medium2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/uploadedImage_medium2-e1351819836297.png" alt="" width="360" height="523" /></a></p>
<p>More details on those later, because it's been an adventure and I don't want my first post back after my hiatus to be a novel. Also, I'm planning on doing NaBloPoMo (sort of NaNoWriMo for bloggers -- one post per day for the month of November) and I'm going to need material.</p>
<p>I've also knit a hat. It's the I &lt;3 PomPoms pattern, minus the pompoms because while I like the look of them, I hate making them. I might go ahead and tack them on at some point, but for now I'm fine without them. I used 2 1/2 skeins Crystal Palace's Kaya Kaya yarn in the colorway Mosaic, a bulky yarn that I scored for a fantastic $1 per skein, and has since been languishing in The Stash for at least a couple of years. The pattern calls for a worsted yarn at a gauge of 4sts/inch. I hit that gauge but because the yarn is bulky rather than worsted, the hat didn't come out quite as floppy as the pattern intended. No matter, I prefer a denser fabric for my hats because it's warmer.</p>

<p>I am pleased with how it came out. It's a little goofy looking, but I'm okay with that.</p>
<p>Ever since I saw the <a href="http://knitty.com/ISSUEdf11/PATTboyfriend.php">Shapely Boyfriend sweater</a> from the Deep Fall 2011 issue of Knitty, I've been somewhat obsessed with having an orange cardigan. Not just any orange, though, the perfect autumny orange that hearkened of pumpkin pies and changing leaves. Last year I bought a sweater in this perfect color, but since it's lightweight and a pullover besides it didn't quite satisfy my itch. This year, I've bought yarn in the perfect color -- Berroco Vintage in Tang. And I've got my eye on these great buttons from Natural Stitches that are sort of a basketweave of copper and gold that I think would look just smashing against the orange, but I'm holding off until I knit my buttonholes before buying buttons just so I'm sure they fit. I cast on for a swatch for it because I couldn't take another night of socks.</p>
<p>I opened up the Knitty pattern to check what gauge I should be aiming for, and it calls for four stitches to the inch. That's sort of loose, thought I, so I skimmed back to the yarn it calls for...</p>
<p>Aran weight.</p>
<p>Berroco Vintage is decidedly not aran weight. It's worsted (and sort of a lightish worsted at that, in this humble knitter's opinion) and there's no way I'm going to get it to knit up at 4 sts/inch and end up with a sweater I like, much less will actually wear. Sidenote: this is why you should always read through the pattern before purchasing yarn, kids!</p>
<p>So I ditched the plan for a Shapely Boyfriend and sorted through patterns until I found a similarly basic cardigan that calls for a worsted yarn. I'll be knitting <a href="http://www.berroco.com/exclusives/runcorn/runcorn.html">Runcorn</a>, minus the different colors and textured stripes. I figure knitting this in between the socks will be enough to take the edge off, plus I'll end up with a great sweater just as the seasons are changing. Win-win in my book.</p>
<p>And thus completes NaBloPoMo, Day One. See ya tomorrow!</p>
