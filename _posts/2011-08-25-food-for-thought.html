<p>I'll be the first to admit that one of the biggest motivations in my life is food. Couple that with an over-active imagination and a somewhat obsessive personality, and reading about food in books becomes its own unique sort of torment.</p>
<p>For example, I can't read the scene where Scarlett is forced to eat a huge breakfast before the party at Twelve Oaks in <em>Gone with the Wind </em>without desperately craving an enormous breakfast myself. Upon reading about Edmund's gluttonous reaction to the Turkish Delight conjured for him by the White Witch in <em>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe</em>, I begged my grandmother to buy some for me so I could eat it too. (That never happened. Apparently Turkish Delight is not readily available in most Floridian grocery stores, but I'm still keeping my eye out for some...) And don't even get me started on the sweet torture that is <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>. By the way, the actual candy they sell with Willie Wonka's name slapped on it? Not nearly as good as it is inside my head.</p>
<p>One of my latest literary food obsessions has been Jaffa Cakes, thanks to the Armourer in Simon R. Green's <em>Secret Histories</em> novels. This character constantly asks for Jaffa Cakes, insisting that he is unable to work without them. I'd been imagining little tea cakes or something, so imagine my surprise when I discovered a box of them at my local grocery store. I had to buy them, of course, and probably paid entirely too much for them since they're a British import. But I'd say they were totally worth every penny. They're actually a cakey-sort of cookie, with a "squidgy orange bit" (their description, not mine!) which is sort of like a thicker orange jelly on top, and then the whole thing is coated in chocolate. I see why the Armourer is unable to work without them, but at nearly $6 for a box of ten smallish cookies, they'll just have to remain the (very) occasional treat for me, probably about as often as Green puts out a new novel and I get them stuck in my head again.<br /></p>
