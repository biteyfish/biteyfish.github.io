<p>I apologize for not posting. My apology comes with a picture of my Wollmeise haul and my stupid cat. That's Yarneater. Notice how she is lurking. She's an awful cat.</p>
<p>Not a whole lot is going on knit-wise right now. I'm working on a scarf for a friend that is taking for-ev-er. Um. That's really it.</p>
<p>I really need to knit more so I actually have something to blog about...</p>
